Emerging Technology of Network and Telecommunications Management
This essay discusses the evolution and distinctions between network management and telecommunications management, emphasizing the increasing convergence of these fields. It covers:

Differences in focus: network management handles data transfer and performance, while telecommunications management focuses on voice and communication services.
The impact of emerging technologies like cloud computing, 5G, and VoIP in reshaping how network and telecommunications are managed.
The importance of performance metrics, monitoring systems, and addressing technical debt to maintain efficient and scalable systems.
The adaptation required by IT departments to manage both network and telecommunications in an integrated manner.
Introduction to Network Monitoring (PowerPoint)
This presentation introduces the concept of IT systems monitoring, explaining its importance in ensuring smooth operations across networks. Key points include:

Definitions of monitoring, with a focus on proactive vs. reactive approaches.
The role of alerts, events, logs, metrics, and dashboards in monitoring network performance.
Examples of how proactive monitoring can detect issues early, such as CPU usage spikes or low disk space, and how reactive monitoring addresses problems post-event.
Specific metrics like packet loss and disk I/O wait time, with examples of thresholds and their impacts on performance.
A detailed availability calculation scenario for a fictitious system, showing the importance of uptime in customer satisfaction.
